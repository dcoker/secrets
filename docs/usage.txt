A CLI for managing secrets.

Secrets are encrypted with an ephemeral key managed by KMS. The
ciphertexts are stored in a local YAML file.

To store your first secret:

	$ secrets -f frontend.yml -k arn:aws:kms:us-west...:key/24f... put db_username putin
	$ cat frontend.yml
	db_username:
		key_id: arn:aws:kms:us-west...:key/24f...
		key_manager: kms
		key_ciphertext: CiB9r3U+rrvEBKL/7ei...
		algorithm: secretbox
		ciphertext: ehPzEUMsRRP+...

Optionally omit the key when storing subsequent secrets:

	$ secrets -f frontend.yml put db_password 1234

To read secrets:

	$ secrets -f frontend.yml get db_password
	1234

Secrets are encrypted locally using secretbox (NaCl) or AES-GCM-256.

Policies or Grants attached to KMS keys determine which IAM users or
roles are allowed to perform encryption and decryption operations under a
specific key. Writing secrets requires kms:GenerateDataKey and reading secrets
requires kms:Decrypt. All KMS operations are logged to CloudTrail.

Depending on your particular AWS configuration, you may need to set the
AWS_REGION or AWS_PROFILE environment variables.
